Course practical for AE4422-20 Agent-based Modelling and Simulation for Air Transportation.

This git repo contains implementations of several path planners that are used to solver an arbitrary multiagent path finding problem. The solutions include:

- a prioritize A* path planner,
- a CBS and CBS cycle limited path planner,
- and a distributed path planner.

Below is a gif demonstrating the CBS cycle limited solver solving a sliding puzzle, with each puzzle piece being an agent.
